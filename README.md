Learning journey of MERN stack course by Simplilearn on YT.

### What is a tech stack?
The tech stack is a combination of programming languages, frameworks, and tools that developers use to build a web or mobile app.
- Server Side: Web Framework, Programming Language, Database, Web Server, Operating System
- Client Side: JS, HTML, CSS, React etc.

#### MEAN: MongoDB, ExpressJs, AngularJs, NodeJs
  - Angular is a framework developed by Google
  - Uses TS(TypeScript)
  - Flow is bi-directional (Changes in View part is reflected in Model as well)
  - Better learning curve
  - Better for enterprises and larger projects

#### MERN: MongoDB, ExpressJs, ReactJs, NodeJs
  - React is a JavaScript library.
  - Uses JS and JSX(Javascript Extended Syntax)
  - Here uni-directional (Changes go through Models first)
  - Excellent Documentation
  - Quicker and for smaller projects in general

### React
  - JS library for building fast and interactive user interfaces for the web as well as mobile applications
  - Open Source, Reusable component based front-end library
  - Developed at Facebook for View part in an application

#### Why React?
  - Easy creation of dynamic web app
  - Performance enhancements
  - Reusable components
  - Unidirectional data flow
  - Small learning curve
  - Can be used for mobile apps

#### Features of React
  - JSX:
      - Syntax extensions to JS. Used with React to describe what the UI should look like
      - By using JSX, one can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JS code
      - Easier to understand and debug as VirtualDOM is used rather than actual one.
      - e.g.
        ```js
        const simple = <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
        ```
  - Virtual DOM:
      - Creates a copy of Real DOM and compares previous snapshot of VDOM to identify changes which makes it faster
  - Performance and one-way data binding
      - Components are functional in nature that is they may depend on arguments and may return a value
  - Extensions
      - Provides server side rendering
      - Supports mobile app development using React Native
      - Extended with Flux and Redux
  - Debugging
      - Easy to debug because of huge community
